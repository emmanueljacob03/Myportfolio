								<h2>Sports</h2>
								<p>Playing a sport is a terrific form of relaxation after a long day and lets off stress. It also enables me to live better and happier, as regular sports and fitness activities have been shown to offer social and psychological benefits in addition to physical ones. I've always been interested in athletics and have participated in a variety of activities since I was a child. To date, I've learned how to play a variety of sports. I've always loved cricket, as do many others in our nation, and I've also won multiple awards in football and basketball.

									<h2 class="major">Traveling</h2>
									<p>Saint Augustine once said, "The world is a book, and those who do not travel read only a page." More than any university subject, travel may educate you more. You gain knowledge of the culture of the country you are visiting. If you speak with locals, you will most likely discover their beliefs, customs, traditions, and history. Traveling may teach you a great deal about yourself. You can monitor how you feel while you are away from home. You'll discover how you feel about your home country. You'll realize how you feel about folks from other countries. You'll discover how much you know and how little you know about the world. You'll be able to watch how you react in unfamiliar situations. You'll be put to the test in terms of language, orientation, and social skills. After you come home, you will not be the same person.

											<h2 class="major"> INTERESTS
											</h2>
											
											<p>Interests are usually a little difficult to achieve because, no matter how much we want them to happen, life has a way of blocking the view. As I am from India, I have always had a wide range of interests. I'd always had a dream and was a sports fanatic.  I always wanted to pursue my career in sports, particularly cricket. My family, however, as desi parents, did not push me to pursue it. My chances of getting into sports have completely vanished as I've grown older. So I started concentrating on my studies, and my field of interest shifted totally, and I chose to continue a career as a data scientist. </p>

											<h2 class="major"> Hobbies</h2>
											</h3>
											<p>HOBBIES are the only things that can help us forget about the outside world and relax for a while. Hobbies not only bring back memories of our childhood, but they also stimulate our minds and make us joyful. Every person has a unique collection of interests. My interests include: Video Games Script Writing Watching Movies Long Drives Sporting   Every one of the hobbies listed above is my favourite. During a lengthy Covid-19 break (pandemic). At home, I was bored, so a few of my friends pushed me to play some online multiplayer games. </p>
