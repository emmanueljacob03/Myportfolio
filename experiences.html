				<h2 class="major">Data Analyst</h2>
					<p>I’m incredibly grateful for my internship at Goodyear, where I built a strong foundation in SAP and gained valuable insight into large-scale manufacturing operations. I developed scalable backend workflows, ETL pipelines, and SAP Mobile interfaces to improve data accessibility and reliability. I integrated large SAP datasets into real-time dashboards, performed data validation and transformation, and created clean, reusable batch jobs. Collaborating in Agile sprints and CI/CD pipelines, this experience sharpened my technical skills in backend development, ERP systems, and enterprise data solutions—skills I’m excited to carry forward into my future roles.</p>

			<h2 class="major">Graduate Research Assistant</h2>
				<p>I worked as a Graduate Research Assistant at the National Construction Center for Safety (NCCS), where I contributed to a cutting-edge 3D Printed Housing research project. My role focused on developing real-time OpenGL simulations using C++ in a Linux environment, building custom 3D rendering pipelines, and integrating civil engineering designs into digital models for structural visualization. I collaborated closely with multidisciplinary teams to align software with real-world construction practices and ensured high-performance outputs through advanced graphics and systems programming. Following this, I joined the Political Science Department at the University of Kansas, where I worked on data-heavy research projects like China Ties, Section 301, and Section 232. I automated ETL pipelines with Python, performed data scraping and preprocessing using R, and created impactful Tableau dashboards for policy and economic analysis. These experiences helped me grow as a developer and data analyst, giving me hands-on exposure to both cutting-edge research and real-world problem-solving across domains.</p>

			<h2 class="major">Data Scientist</h2>
				<p>Before that, I worked as a Data Scientist Intern at DC Ikigai Pvt Ltd, where I contributed to a real-world stock market forecasting project. I developed and fine-tuned machine learning models using Python, PySpark, and Databricks to predict stock trends and business performance. I built REST APIs for delivering predictive insights, engineered features for profit and sales analysis, and automated ETL pipelines using Azure Data Factory and Snowflake. I also worked with SQL Server for data modeling and optimized querying, while following CI/CD practices through Azure DevOps. This hands-on experience strengthened my skills in data pipelines, cloud platforms, and deploying ML models in production.</p>

			<h2 class="major">Python Developer</h2>
				<p>I had the opportunity to work as a Python Development Associate at The Entrepreneurship Network (TEN) from July to October 2021, where I contributed to real-time projects using Python, Django, and Flask. I developed backend modules, built and deployed full-stack web applications, and strengthened my skills in MVC architecture, RESTful API development, and database management with SQLite and PostgreSQL. Following that, I worked as a Data Scientist Intern at DC Ikigai Pvt Ltd, where I built and tuned machine learning models for stock market forecasting using Python, PySpark, and Databricks. I also developed REST APIs, automated ETL pipelines with Azure Data Factory and Snowflake, and followed CI/CD practices using Azure DevOps. Together, these experiences laid a strong foundation in both software and data engineering, helping me become a versatile, solution-oriented professional.</p>

			<h2 class="major">Data Scientist and Business Analyst</h2>
				<p>After that, I had the opportunity to work as a Machine Learning Intern at The Sparks Foundation, where I applied core ML concepts to real-world datasets through project-based learning. During this time, I built and evaluated supervised models like linear regression, logistic regression, and decision trees using Python and Scikit-learn, and also applied unsupervised techniques such as K-Means Clustering for classification tasks. I handled data preprocessing with Pandas and NumPy, visualized distributions and model performance with Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly, and participated in capstone projects involving model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation using confusion matrices, ROC-AUC, and cross-validation. I deployed end-to-end ML pipelines in Jupyter Notebooks, bridging academic theory with practical skills, and further strengthening my passion for AI/ML-driven real-world solutions.</p>
