										<p>I have hidden text in an image using image steganography, and the text is encrypted using DES and LSB encryption with K means clustering. The encryption message is hidden in the image from the sender's side then sent to the receiver's side and the text can be decrypted by the DES algorithm.</p>

										<p>I developed a desktop tool for GUI design that works on any operating system. It can take data and process everything in the data science pipeline and utilise text mining to accept a question and provide a visualise result (for multiple questions) as well as compile all of the visualisations into a report at the end, with the output being a pdf or image format of the report.</p>

										<h3 class="major">DC IKIGAI
										</h3>
										<p>This DC IKIGAI is a startup organization, where I worked as a data scientist for 3 months at the backend as an intern. I used to deal with day-to-day tasks here, and I've accomplished several projects, of which the main project was Stock Market Forecast Using Machine Learning and Python, in which we had to carry and deliver the best stock prediction to consumers based on their annual income, monthly expenses, age, and other factors. This allowed me to get a great deal of knowledge and gain a better understanding of marketing and time management.</p>

										<h3 class="major">TEN ENTREPRENEURSHIP NETWORK</h3>
										<p>In TEN ENTREPRENEURSHIP NETWORK, I worked as a python assistant for three months at the backend as an intern. I worked in a team with a high level of productivity and finished several week-wise tasks to develop skills and completed projects ahead of schedule. We have given several types of real-life challenges to solve with the help of python using Django and flask in these projects. Through these tasks, we have gained knowledge in python full-stack development.</p>
