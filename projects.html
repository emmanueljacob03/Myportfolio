				<h2>Autism Diagnosis using Machine Learning and neural networks</h2>
					<p>Designed and implemented a deep neural network for autism diagnosis using existing datasets, achieving a 20% improvement in prediction accuracy compared to traditional methods. Leveraged the NGG16 model and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to extract and classify image features such as facial expressions and behavioral cues. Built a modular preprocessing and data integration pipeline using SQL to handle diverse datasets. Developed an explainable AI (XAI) dashboard with heatmaps and visualizations to enhance model transparency, and created an interactive tool for clinical professionals to upload images and receive real-time diagnostic predictions with confidence scores.</p>

			<h2>SAP Mobile</h2>
				<p>During my internship at The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company, I gained hands-on experience working with SAP BW and SAP Mobile platforms to support large-scale manufacturing operations. Despite having no prior background in SAP, I quickly built a strong foundation in enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems and backend development. I developed and optimized scalable backend workflows and ETL pipelines within a Linux environment, ensuring seamless data integration across multiple departments. One of my key projects involved configuring user interfaces for SAP Mobile, enabling field planners and craftsmen to easily check product availability and place orders directly from any location within the plant, significantly improving operational efficiency and reducing downtime. I also performed extensive data validation, cleansing, and transformation to enhance data quality and reliability, supporting real-time analytics and dashboarding initiatives. In addition, I designed SAP-based transformations and scheduled batch jobs focused on clean, modular, and reusable code practices. Collaborating closely within Agile teams and following CI/CD practices, I was actively involved in sprint planning, task visualization, code reviews, and deployment activities. This immersive experience greatly strengthened my skills in SAP BW, ERP systems, backend architecture, data engineering, and enterprise-scale digital solutions, capabilities I am excited to carry into my next professional opportunity.</p>

			<h2>Stock Market Trend forecasting</h2>
				<p>I developed and fine-tuned machine learning models to predict stock price trends using Python, PySpark, and Databricks. I built a robust pipeline that integrated large datasets, performed feature engineering, and applied time series analysis techniques to improve prediction accuracy. The project involved creating real-time predictive models through REST APIs, allowing seamless integration with web and analytics platforms. I utilized Azure Data Factory and Snowflake to automate ETL workflows, ensuring efficient data ingestion and transformation. Additionally, I implemented CI/CD practices with Azure DevOps and Databricks Workflows for streamlined model deployment and monitoring. Through this project, I was able to deliver actionable insights via dashboards and reports, enabling better decision-making for stakeholders. The experience enhanced my skills in machine learning, data engineering, and deploying scalable solutions.</p>

			<h2>IMAGE STEGANOGRAPHY USING K-MEANS CLUSTERING AND DES ENCYPTION</h2>
				<p>I developed a secure image steganography system that integrates K-means clustering and Data Encryption Standard (DES) encryption to conceal confidential information within digital images. The project began by applying K-means clustering to segment the image into distinct pixel groups, enabling strategic embedding of data into the least significant bits (LSB) of selected clusters while maintaining visual quality and minimizing the risk of detection. Before embedding, the secret data was encrypted using DES, adding an extra layer of protection to ensure that even if the hidden data were discovered, it could only be accessed with the correct decryption key. The two-step algorithm first clustered the image to optimize data hiding capacity and then applied encryption to maintain confidentiality. I evaluated the system’s performance by measuring Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Mean Squared Error (MSE), achieving high data integrity and minimal image distortion. Additionally, I built a user-friendly graphical interface that allowed users to select images, input secret messages, and visualize both the embedding and extraction processes. Through careful application of image processing and security techniques, the system achieved a strong balance between security, data capacity, and the visual imperceptibility of the steganographic process.</p>

			<h2>Acceleration Search Based Program Synthesis Using Learned Probabilistic Models</h2>
				<p>Designed and implemented a novel program synthesis framework leveraging probabilistic models to improve synthesis accuracy and execution efficiency. Utilized PHOG (Probabilistic Higher-Order Grammar) for grammar-based synthesis and implemented cluster-specific learning to adapt models based on input patterns. Applied STAR (Syntax- and Type-Aware Refinement) algorithms for guiding synthesis through logical deduction and constraint satisfaction. Developed data processing pipelines with Python, using Pickle for efficient serialization and deserialization of large clustered datasets. Employed subprocess modules for orchestrating cross-module training, inference, and logging activities in an automated manner. Integrated logging mechanisms to track clustering, training, and testing performance across multiple experiment configurations. Achieved optimized performance by selectively training on clustered datasets using K-means, improving the system’s scalability and reducing training overhead. Validated model robustness on benchmark datasets (e.g., StackOverflow, ExcelJet, and custom DSLs) under varied testing scenarios with time-bound constraints. Logged comparative results using both cluster-specific grammars and general grammars, highlighting performance trade-offs and synthesis quality.</p>

			<h2>Enhancing ZSL: Integrating Real-Time Processing and Response for Efficient IOT Device Classification</h2>
				<p>Enhancing ZSL: Integrating Real-Time Processing and Response for Efficient IOT Device Classification. Enhancing ZSL: Integrating Real-Time Processing and Response for Efficient IOT Device Classification. We worked on enhancing the Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL) framework for efficient IoT device classification in dynamic networks. Traditional methods rely on labeled data, which is impractical for continuously emerging IoT devices. Our project integrated Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) and real-time processing to address this challenge. We developed a self-attention-based network feature extractor to capture semantic relationships in network traffic, enabling classification of both seen and unseen devices. A Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) was used to generate pseudo traffic data for unseen devices, and an SVM classifier was trained to classify devices based on this data. To make the system adaptive, we added a real-time processing module that identifies and responds to new devices and security threats instantly, without manual intervention. This approach was tested on the UNSW 2018 IoT dataset, where it outperformed existing unsupervised and semi-supervised methods for ZSL and generalized ZSL settings. The results showed significant improvements in the accuracy and scalability of IoT device classification, demonstrating the effectiveness of our enhancements in real-world scenarios. In conclusion, the project provided a more efficient and secure solution for managing and classifying IoT devices in dynamic environments.
